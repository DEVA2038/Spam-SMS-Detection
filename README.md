ðŸš€ Project Completed: Spam SMS Detection ðŸ“±
I recently worked on a machine learning project where I built an AI model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Using techniques like TF-IDF and models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM, the model was trained to detect unwanted messages effectively.
This was a great hands-on experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text classification!
